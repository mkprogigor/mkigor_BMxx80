# mkigor_BMxx80 (BMP280, BME280, BME680)
Lightweight and short library for Bosch sensor BME280, BMP280, BME680 for Arduino.
It is not pretend to the most optimal code, but it is example of learning C++ OOP for programing MCU: classes, encapsulating metods (functions), inheritance classes.
Classes cl_BME280, cl_BME680 inherit from cl_BMP280.

## BMP280, BME280, BME680
By default, lib focused on one time measuring (forced mode, but normal available too) 
with max oversampling x16 of T,P,H, filter x2. It's suitable for weather station.

Function (metod) => `uint8_t check(uint8_t lv_i2caddr)`<BR>
It must be call 1st, because it checks presence of sensor!<BR>
Fn check connection with sensor by I2C address `lv_i2caddr` (usually 0x76 or 0x77).<BR>
Fn return byte: 0 = if sensor does not present or CHIP CODE in otherwise.<BR>
Possible chip codes are: 0x58=>BMP280, 0x60=>BME280, 0x61=>BME680.<BR>
Note: i2c address 0x76, 0x77 possible for BMP280 or BME280 or BME680 - pl, check it.<BR>

Function => `void begin()`<BR>
Default setup: FORCED MODE, with x16 oversampling and x2 filter.<BR>

Function => `void begin(uint8_t mode, uint8_t t_sb, uint8_t filter, uint8_t osrs_t, uint8_t osrs_p, uint8_t osrs_h)`<BR>
Default setup for with Your parameters:<BR>
`mode    = NOR_MODE or FOR_MODE;`<BR>
`t_sb    = standby (sleep) time, from SB_500US to SB_1000MS (for NORMAL mode bmp280, bme280);`<BR>
`filter  =  value of filterring - FIL_OFF, FIL_x2, FIL_x4, FIL_x8, FIL_x16;`<BR>
`osrs_t, osrs_p, osrs_h = oversampling value for T,P,H - OS_OFF, OS_x1, OS_x2, OS_x4, OS_x8, OS_x16.`<BR>

Function => `void do1Meas(void)`<BR>
Makes 1 measurement and goes to sleep (FORCED MODE). The function don't use delay or wait for result, only send command to sensor - start measuring. You should do delay and check moment (`isMeas()`) when measuring data will be finish. You can use vTaskDelay(200) for benefits of using FreeRTOS.
Max time measuring takes about 200 mS, acording to mode, sleep time, filter and oversamlinhg value.
But You should check it.<BR>

Function => `bool isMeas(void)`<BR>
returns TRUE while sensor IS MEASuring, otherwise FALSE.<BR>

## BME280
Function => `tph_stru readTPH(void)`<BR>
This metod (function) DOES NOT make measurement! The function only reads RAW data in one I2C request, decoding to real (compensate) value T,P,H and return it in structure variable.<BR>
```c++
struct tph_srtu {
  float temp1;
  float pres1;
  float humi1;
};
```
## BME680
Function => `void begin()`<BR>
Default init bme680: FORCED MODE, with x16 oversampling T P H and x2 filter.<BR>
Fn => `void begin(uint8_t filter, uint8_t osrs_t, uint8_t osrs_p, uint8_t osrs_h)`<BR>
Init bme680 with Your parameters:<BR>
`filter                  = value of filterring;`<BR>
`osrs_t, osrs_p, osrs_h  = oversampling value for T,P,H.`<BR>

Function => `void initGasPointX(uint8_t point, uint16_t tagTemp, uint16_t duration, int16_t ambTemp);`<BR>
It is need use additional init function for BME680 sensor configurate heat set point 0..9:<br>
`uint8_t  point    = number of set point, what You want to use 0..9;`<br>
`uint16_t tagTemp  = target temperature fof preheating Gas sensor (250-350);`<br>
`uint16_t duration = time duration of preheating in ms (30-150);`<br>
`int16_t  ambTemp  = ambient temperature.`<br>

Function => `tph_stru readTPHG(void)`<BR>
This metod DOES NOT make measurement! The function only reads RAW data in one I2C request, decoding to real (compensate) value T,P,H,G and return it in structure variable.<BR>
```c++
struct tphg_srtu {
  float temp1;
  float pres1;
  float humi1;
  float gasr1;
};
```

I used oficial Bosch datasheet bmp280, bme280, bme680. But datasheets have errors, I finded working code in next libs, becouse THE CODE IS THE DOCUMENTATION :-) I thanks authors for help in coding:<BR>
